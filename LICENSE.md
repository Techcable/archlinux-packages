# Licensing
It is unclear how packages in the Arch User Repository (AUR) are licensed.

There seems to be a general consensus that `PKGBUILD` files are too trivial
to be protected by copyright.

However, to avoid any doubt, I am explicitly dual-licensing all contributions
I make to packages in this repositry under the [`CC0`] and [`Apache-2.0`] licenses
unless I explicitly state otherwise.

This includes the `PKGBUILD` files themselves in addition to any patches
and script files.

[`CC0`]: https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/
[`Apache-2.0`]: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0

## Contributions
Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in this project by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0 license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms or conditions.
