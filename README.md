# techcable-archlinux-packages
Techcable's packages for archlinux.

Most packages are published to the [Arch Linux Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_User_Repository)
and are kept under the `aur` subdirectory.

Individual packages are split into their own repositories using [`git-subrepo`](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo).

Contributions are welcome.
